    <h2> This Website!</h2>
    <p>I taught myself HTML and CSS during my second semester of my freshman year. <br>
      I wanted learn what I could do with my coding knowledge and use it in the real world.

      <h2>BLUELab Yucatán</h2>
    <p> I am on the sensor team on the BLUELab Yucatán Project team. 
        Our project this year focuses on gathering air quality data through
        the use of sensors and Arduinos to ensure the biodigesters are working properly 
        and their users are safe.
